# Blockchain for maintaining Digital Assets

> **NOTE**: This developer pattern creates a blockchain network on *IBM Blockchain Platform version **2.5*** using the *Hyperledger Fabric version **1.4***.

In this code pattern, we will be building a digital asset management application by creating and deploying a smart contract on a Hyperledger Fabric Network created on IBM Blockchain Platform. We will then interact with this application via a user interface created using VueJS.

Digital Asset Management Systems ensure that operations are only performed on a digital asset by individuals (or organizations) that have the right access rights and permissions for the asset. The digital asset is defined as the content (an image, a music file, a document, a video file, etc.) and its metadata. The metadata could be as simple as the name of the asset, the name of the owner of the asset and the date of creation of the asset, or it could be something more complex, such as extracted speech from a video (subtitles). In any Digital Asset Management system, there can be any number of users and these users can have the ability to perform various actions on the asset in the system based on the permissions they have. Examples of such actions that are being covered in this developer pattern are: 

1. User registration and user login.
2. Viewing all existing assets in the system.
3. Viewing assets owned by the user that is currently logged in.
4. Uploading a new asset.
5. Deleting an existing asset.
6. Suggesting edits to an existing asset.
7. Viewing suggested edits for an asset that is owned by the user that is currently logged in.
8. Approving or denying suggeested edits for an asset that is owned by the user that is currently logged in.
9. Allowing other users the permission to update an asset owned by the user that is currently logged in.
10. Assigning another user as the owner of an asset that is owned by the user that is currently logged in.
11. Downloading assets.

The large number of users (participants) in this use case, as well as the different kinds of actions (transactions) that can be executed indicate that this is a good use case for Blockchain. Blockchain will also allow for the history of the transactions to be maintained in the ledger, thereby ensuring that there is always a chain of record for any changes that have been made to any asset.

We will start by packaging the Node.js smart contract using the IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code. Next, we will create a Hyperledger Fabric Network on IBM Blockchain Platform where we will install and instantiate the smart contract. We will also set up an IBM Cloud Object Storage instance, where we can retain the digital assets uploaded to the Digital Asset Management application, and a fake SMTP testing server using Mailtrap.io to test the email notifications sent by the application. Finally, the VueJS web application, which makes use of the Hyperledger Fabric SDK, can be used to interact with the network.

When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

* Package a blockchain smart contract using the IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code.
* Set up a Hyperledger Fabric network on IBM Blockchain Platform.
* Install and instantiate a smart contract package through IBM Blockchain Platform.
* Set up an instance of the IBM Cloud Object Storage service and connect it with the Node.js application.
* Test the blockchain network by executing a Node.js application with the Hyperledger Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network by issuing transactions.

</p>

1. The Blockchain Operator sets up the IBM Blockchain Platform service.
2. The IBM Blockchain Platform service creates a Hyperledger Fabric network on an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, and the Blockchain Operator installs and instantiates the smart contract on the network.
3. The Node.js application server uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform, IBM Cloud Object Storage instance and the Mailtrap Server (fake SMTP testing server) and creates APIs for a web client.
4. The Vue.js client uses the Node.js application API to interact with the network.
5. The User interacts with the Vue.js web interface to interact with the digital asset management application.

8. [Run the application](#8-run-the-application)


### 1. Clone the repo

Clone this repository in a folder your choice:

```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/Blockchain-for-maintaining-Digital-Assets.git
```


### 2. Package the smart contract

We will use the IBM Blockchain Platform extension on VS Code to package the smart contract.

* Open Visual Studio code and open the `contract` folder from `Blockchain-for-maintaining-Digital-Assets` repository that was cloned earlier. 
   **It is important that you are opening the `contract` folder and not the entire `Blockchain-for-maintaining-Digital-Assets` directory; otherwise you will see an error that states that it doesn't understand what programming language you are using.**

* Press the `F1` key to see the different VS code options. Choose `IBM Blockchain Platform: Package Open Project`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910509-05036d00-3140-11ea-8b15-7c8aeb403974.png">
</p>

* Click the `IBM Blockchain Platform` extension button on the left. This will show the packaged contracts on top and the blockchain connections on the bottom.

<p align="center">
  <img height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/85961325-ae9d1b80-b977-11ea-89d9-4c9b2e627c59.png">
</p>

* Next, right click on the packaged contract (in this case, select blockchain-for-maintaining-digital-assets@0.0.1) to export it and choose `Export Package`.

* Choose a location on your machine and save the `.cds` file. We will use this packaged smart contract later to deploy on the IBM Blockchain Platform service.

Now, we will start setting up the different services required for configuring our Hyperledger Fabric network on the IBM Cloud and for running our application using this network.


### 3. Create the Mailtrap server

* Create the [Mailtrap server](https://mailtrap.io). You can sign up using your Google or Github account or using your email address. Once the account has been created and you have logged in, create a new inbox by typing in an inbox name and clicking on `Create Inbox`.

<p align="center">
  <img height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910507-046ad680-3140-11ea-9317-aa9219ae1383.gif">
</p>


### 4. Create IBM Cloud services

* Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/cluster). You can find the service in the `Catalog`. For this code pattern, we can use the `Free` cluster, and give it a name. Note, that the IBM Cloud allows one instance of a free cluster which expires after 30 days. **Note: it could take 20 minutes for the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service setup to complete**.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910506-046ad680-3140-11ea-9f4b-8bcb4d2a651b.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Create the [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloud-object-storage) service on the IBM Cloud. You can find the service in the `Catalog`, and give it a name.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71918961-80b9e580-3151-11ea-8efc-8d4a08b55380.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Create the [IBM Blockchain Platform](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/blockchain-platform) service on the IBM Cloud. You can find the service in the `Catalog`, and give it a name.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910502-046ad680-3140-11ea-9853-3598b9363d91.gif">
</p>
<br>

* After your kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform on the cluster. Again - wait for the IBM Cloud Kubernetes service to indicate it was deployed. The IBM Blockchain Platform service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910501-046ad680-3140-11ea-8440-9d2fef0be426.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you can launch the console to start configuring your blockchain network.

    - The <b>enroll id</b> and <b>enroll secret</b> for your app admin, which we earlier provided as `app-admin` and `app-adminpw` respectively.
    - The orgMSP ID, which we provided as `Org1MSP`.
    - The caName, which can be found in your connection json file under "organizations" -> "Org1MSP" -> certificateAuthorities". This would be like an IP address and a port.
    - The peerName, which can be found in your connection json file under "organizations" -> "Org1MSP" -> peers". This would be like an IP address and a port.
    - Update gateway discovery to `{ enabled: true, asLocalhost: false }` to connect to IBM Blockchain Platform.
    - Go to your inbox on mailtrap.io and choose `Nodemailer` in the dropdown under `Integrations`. Obtain the host, port, auth.user and auth.pass values and specify them as smtpHost, smtpPort, smtpUserName and smtpPassword values in the config.json file. <br><p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/85883435-fc1a5c80-b7ae-11ea-885b-20796d4dba81.gif"></p><br>
     - Go to your IBM Cloud Object Storage instance and go to `Buckets` in the left hand navigation pane and click on `Create bucket`. Choose `Standard` under Predefined buckets. Provide a `Unique bucket name` as per the naming rules specified. Skip the `Upload files` step and click `Next`. Skip the `Test bucket out` step and click `Next`. Once the bucket is successfully created, obtain the following information from the webpage:
        - Under `Bucket details`, obtain the bucket name and specify it as cos_bucketName in the config.json.
        - Under `Service Credentials`, obtain the apikey and resource_instance_id values and specify them as the cos_apiKeyId and cos_serviceInstanceId respectively in the config.json.
        - Under `Endpoints`, obtain the `Public` endpoint and specify this value as the cos_endpoint in the config.json file<br><p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/85887092-2838dc00-b7b5-11ea-8dbd-e70da8f2c9b3.gif"></p><br>
    
Once all this is done, your config.json should look something like this:

```bash
 {
    "channel_name": "mychannel",
    "smart_contract_name": "blockchain-for-maintaining-digital-assets",
    "connection_file": "Org1MSP_profile.json",
    "appAdmin": "app-admin",
    "appAdminSecret": "app-adminpw",
    "orgMSPID": "Org1MSP",
    "caName": "184.172.229.220:31844",
    "peerName": "184.172.229.220:30884",
    "gatewayDiscovery": { "enabled": true, "asLocalhost": false },
    "smtpHost": "smtp.mailtrap.io",
    "smtpPort": 2525,
    "smtpUserName": "cb49e25f8cbe5f",
    "smtpPassword": "3734c09cfdj05f",
    "senderEmail": "no-reply@digitalassetscodepattern.com",
    "cos_endpoint": "s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud",
    "cos_apiKeyId": "QrC2rLBkjEmS755xR88_78seDgD2ai8DIQxVd74G21Je",
    "cos_serviceInstanceId": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloud-object-storage:global:a/86ac1b16b6f8b9639124a38d8edbd301:2f8d9627-46ff-46e9-a053-9d3e7121eedf::",
    "cos_bucketName": "blockchain-digital-assets-bucket"
 }
```


### 8. Run the application

#### In a new terminal, navigate to the [`server`](web-app/server) directory:

  ```bash
  cd Blockchain-for-maintaining-digital-assets/web-app/server/
  ```


#### Build the node dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  
  
#### Enroll the admin and add identity to the wallet:
  
  **Note: This creates public and private key files for the app-admin in the _idwallet folder inside the [config folder](web-app/server/config). If a folder named "app-admin" exists in the "_idwallet" folder, then the following command will not enroll the app-admin as it already exists in the wallet. Remove the app-admin folder and then run the following command.**
  
  ```bash
  node enrollAdmin.js
  ```


#### Start the server:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```


#### In a separate terminal, navigate to the [`client`](web-app/client) directory:

  ```bash
  cd Blockchain-for-maintaining-digital-assets/web-app/client/
  ```
  
  
#### Build the node dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```


#### Start the client:

  ```bash
  npm run serve
  ```

Once both the server and client have successfully started, the UI can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080/?#/](http://localhost:8080/?#/).

# Troubleshooting

If you get an error that says `Error: Calling register endpoint failed with error [Error: self signed certificate]`, you can get past this by adding `"httpOptions": {"verify": false}` to the certificateAuthorities section of the connection profile that was downloaded from IBM Blockchain Platform.
